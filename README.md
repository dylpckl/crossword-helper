# crossword-helper

Crosscheck: type a word or phrase, get candidate crossword answers as letter
tiles plus what it means. Mobile-first PWA, no backend.

## Develop

```sh
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm test           # vitest: pattern parser, provider mappers, orchestrator
npm run build      # typecheck + production build into dist/
npm run preview    # serve dist/ locally (service worker active)
```

## Check the endpoints

Open the menu (top left) and choose **API status**. It calls every upstream
endpoint from the current origin and reports status, latency, and whether the
browser let the response through. Run it from a deployed origin at least once
before trusting the no-backend design; "Failed to fetch" with the network up
means CORS or a content blocker.

## Deploy

Pushing to `main` builds and deploys to GitHub Pages via
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. Enable Pages with source "GitHub Actions" in
the repository settings once. Any static host works too: `npm run build` and
serve `dist/` (set `BASE_PATH` if the app lives under a sub-path).

## Data sources
